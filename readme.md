**Welcome to the Sadhana Sevak Project!**

This is a project that aims to give advice to people based on Swami Chinmayananda's commentary of the 2nd and 3rd chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

These are the Karma Yoga chapters that govern how a man of wisdom should perform actions.

The model is pretrained with these chapters, and I hope it helps some people make new and better decisions!
