**Welcome to the Sadhana Sevak Project!**

This is a project that aims to give advice to people based on Swami Chinmayananda's commentary of the 3rd chapter of the Bhagavad Gita.

This is the Karma Yoga chapter that govern how a man of wisdom should perform actions.

The model is pretrained with this chapter, and I hope it helps some people make new and better decisions!
